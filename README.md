# What are Some Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript?

When working with TypeScript, we developers often encounter two ways to define the shape of data: **interfaces** and **type aliases**. While they may seem similar on the surface, there are some important differences that can influence when and how you use them in a TypeScript project.

---

## Definition and Purpose

- **Interface**: Primarily used to define the structure of objects. Interfaces are ideal when we are modeling the shape of a class or defining contracts in object oriented designs.

- **Type Alias**: More flexible than interfaces. A type alias can represent not only object shapes but also unions, intersections, tuples, and even primitive types.

---

## Key Differences

### 1. Extending and Composition

Interfaces can be extended using the `extends` keyword. We can build upon existing interfaces to create more specific versions.

Type aliases use intersections to compose types. This allows for combining multiple types into one using the `&` operator.

### 2. Declaration Merging

One of the key advantages of interfaces is that they support declaration merging. This means if you define an interface multiple times with the same name, TypeScript merges them automatically.

Type aliases do not support declaration merging. Defining the same type alias more than once results in an error.

### 3. Union and Intersection Types

Only type aliases can define union types (a type that could be one of several options) and intersection types (a type that combines multiple types).

Interfaces cannot define unions. They're limited to describing object shapes. It is made for object shapes.

### 4. Primitives and Tuples

Type aliases can be used to represent primitive types like strings or numbers, as well as complex types like tuples.

Interfaces, on the other hand, are meant solely for describing object shapes and cannot be used with primitives or tuples.

## When to Use What?

- Use **interfaces** when we are working with objects, especially in object oriented designs or when we are using third-party libraries that rely on interfaces.

- Use **type aliases** when we need to work with unions, intersections, tuples, or when we are dealing with non-object types.

---

## Conclusion

Both interfaces and type aliases are essential tools in TypeScript that help you write safer, more expressive code. While they overlap in some use cases, their unique capabilities make them better suited for different scenarios. A good rule of thumb is:

**Use interfaces for defining object structures, and use type aliases for everything else.**
